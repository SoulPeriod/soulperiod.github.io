          <h1>Hi, my name is Jarrett Harris.</h1>
          <p>I'm a newly developing Software engineer with a passion for music, cooking, and anything gaming related. I'm a native New Yorker that's born in raised in Queens,
            a avid seeker for peace, love, happiness and lead with excellence in everything I do.
          </p>

          <p>I am currently in an intensive 12-month Software Engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. I aim to bridge my knowledge and passion for music together with software development to help create tools and platforms for independent artists and people of color in order to bring about more agency as well as deeper engagement as a community.
             I consider myself as someone with a myriad of skillsets and desire to bring forth new ideas to fulfillment. As a creative first and foremost, I look to make a lasting impression with whatever it is I have my vision set on and to execute my projects with excellence from start to finish. My desire is to join a team where I can leverage my passions and skills to make a lasting impact..</p>
