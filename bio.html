          <h1>Hi, my name is Jarrett Harris.</h1>
          <p>I'm a newly developing Software engineer with a passion for music, cooking, and anything gaming related. I'm a native New Yorker that's born in raised in Queens,
            a avid seeker for knowledge and lead with excellence in everything I do.
          </p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
